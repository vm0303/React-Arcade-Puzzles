# React-Arcade-Puzzles
During my time in college, so many professors were using puzzle-based games to see how a Computer Science student can solve a problem that has been given to them. With this in mind, I thought that it would be cool to make these puzzles interactive so that people can test their problem-solving skills on thier own.

The Towers of Hanoi moves the tiles from tower to tower, based on the size of the tile's id. I used a bit of Redux becuase React's Drag and Drop and JavaScript's drag and drop are not fully supported on a mobile device.

As for the Sliding Puzzle, I used React Motion to get the slide effect of a single tile in the board since we need to moves the tiles around and restore the board to its original format.
